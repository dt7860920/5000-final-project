## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Motivation**

Professional golf has taken a drastic turn in the last twenty years. From the use of better equipment and new training approaches with powerful data analytics, changes in training algorithms have helped elevate the sport from intuition and muscle memory-based decision making to a data-based framework. Many may wonder: **What actually drives performance on the PGA Tour?**

Amateur golfers tend to highlight physical distance, consistency and accuracy without an accurate measure. The PGA Tour numbers on the other hand feature more sophisticated metrics. **Strokes-gained (SG) is a statistic used to determine how many strokes a player gains or loses on any given shot compared to the field average.** The research examines PGA Tour player performance between 2007 and 2022 through an integration of two publicly available professional databases. In particular, this study focuses specifically on applying data analysis methods in order to uncover the key performance questions and reveal the transformation of modern professional golf.

### **1.2 Research Questions**

Clearly list the key questions your analysis answers, such as:

> 1.  How have key PGA Tour metrics (driving distance, SG metrics) evolved from 2007–2022?
> 2.  Are there identifiable types of PGA Tour players using unsupervised learning?
> 3.  Which performance metrics best predict scoring average on the PGA Tour?
> 4.  What distinguishes winning players from the rest of the field?
> 5.  Is modern success driven more by strokes-gained tee-to-green or putting?
> 6.  Does distance directly contribute to better score or titles won when compared to strokes-gain metrics?

The dataset used for this project merges two separate PGA Tour season-level datasets from **2007–2022**.

After cleaning and standardization, the unified dataframe contains:

> -   **Player name**
>
> -   **Year**
>
> -   **Driving distance (yards)**
>
> -   **Greens in regulation (%)**
>

This dataset is well suited for analyzing:

-   Long-term performance trends

-   Relationships among core performance variables

-   Performance segmentation

-   Predictive modeling of scoring

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **3. Exploratory Data Analysis**

**Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis**

Research question:

> How have key PGA Tour performance metrics evolved from 2007-2022?

To better answer the question, this section will explore the distribution and trends of several key metrics, including scoring average, driving distance, and strokes-gain metrics. Each subsection below focuses on a specific metric and analyzes how its distribution changes over time through data visualization methods.

### **3.1 Trend in Scoring Average Over Time**

Scoring average shows a gradual decline in the 15-year period, from 70.94 to 70.64. This suggests:

-   Improvements in player fitness

-   Equipment advancement

-   Stronger analytical and systematic training method

Even small improvements in PGA scoring average are significant in the given competitiveness of PGA Tour.

### **3.2 Driving Distance Over Time**

Driving distances are trended upwards (indicating something known as the “distance boom” in golf). Contemporary players increasingly emphasize weight and functional training, accelerate swing speeds and use their optimal launch angles as a result for longer drives.

*This aligns with the USGA & R&A (2022) Distance Insights Report and indicates that average driving distance as well as club head speed have gone up every single year on all professional tours, highlighting that the modern game places unprecedented emphasis on power and athleticism.* However, distance itself is only a small section of the golf game, and there is no guarantee that longer distance leads to more wins. Therefore, it leads to another question:

> Does distance directly contribute to better score or titles won when compared to strokes-gain metrics?

This question will be addressed later in the predictive model section.

### **3.3 Relationship Between SG Metrics and Scoring**

Correlations between scoring and strokes-gained show:

-   **SG_TTG is the strongest predictor of low scoring**

-   **SG_T also strongly relates to performance**

-   **SG_P contributes meaningfully but not as dominantly as SG_TTG**

    *This supports findings from Broadie (2011), who showed that the long game (approach + driving) explains most of the variation in scoring among PGA players.*

### **4. Unsupervised Learning — Player Segmentation**

### **4.1 Purpose**

-   The distribution of scoring averages narrows over time, indicating a more competitive field. Usually in a more competitive industry, players will create their own unique route to success, making various types of players, with their own set of characteristics. Unsupervised learning is utilized to find player groups by performance criteria in this section. K-mean = 4 gave valid and consistent clusters after standardization.

-   Research Question:

    > Are there identifiable types of PGA Tour players using unsupervised learning?

![](images/pca_clusters.png){width="70%"}

**Cluster 0 - Balanced Professionals**

-   Average SG metrics

-   Solid but not outstanding in any single category

-   Mid-level scoring average

-   Represents the average players on tour, such as Anthony Kim, Jeff Overton, Kenny Perry

**Cluster 1 - Struggling Players**

-   Negative SG_TTG and SG_T

-   Higher scoring average

-   Few top-10 finishes

-   Reflecting players who struggles to keep their tour status, such as Anders Hanson, Glen Day, Gavin Coles

**Cluster 2 - Elite Ball Strikers**

-   Highest SG_TTG

-   Lowest scoring average

-   Best combination of GIR%, distance, and SG_TTG

-   Most number of wins and top-10s

-   Represents the top tier player on tour, such as Tiger Woods, Ernie Els, Justin Rose

**Cluster 3 - Elite Putters**

-   Highest SG_P

-   Moderate SG_TTG

-   Relies heavily on short-game performance

-   Represents the great putters on tour, such as Arron Oberholser, Padraig Harrington, Tim Clark

### **4.2 Key Insight**

These clusters reflect the competitive nature of the PGA Tour and imply that there is no universal path for success. It seems that SG_TTG is the leading driver of elite golf performance; however, players can still compensate through specialization in driving distance, putting or other areas. By understanding the player profiles, we know how to better guide professional golfers with self-evaluation, training priorities, and performance forecasting.

# **5. Supervised Learning**

### **5.1 Goal**

Research questions:

> 1.  Which performance metrics best predict scoring average on the PGA Tour?
> 2.  What distinguishes winning players from the rest of the field?
> 3.  Is modern success driven more by strokes-gained tee-to-green or putting?
> 4.  Does distance directly contribute to better score or titles won when compared to strokes-gain metrics?

### **5.2 Scoring Average Prediction (Regression)**

To model scoring average, four key performance features were selected:

-   **Driving Distance**

-   **Greens in Regulation % (GIR%)**

-   **Strokes-Gained Putting (SG_P)**

-   **Strokes-Gained Tee-to-Green (SG_TTG)**

The dataset was divided into two training and test set (80/20) using RMSE and R² for model evaluation.

### **Model Performance**

| Model                    | RMSE  | **R²** |
|--------------------------|-------|--------|
| Linear Regression        | 0.192 | 0.910  |
| Random Forest Regression | 0.206 | 0.896  |

### **Interpretation**

The strong performance of the linear regression model demonstrates that scoring average is very predictable by only four metrics. With an R² of 0.91 the model is able to account for 91% of score average variance during 2,700+ player-seasons. Despite Random Forest being a stronger model, the performance was worse which means that the factors that affect scoring are mainly linear in nature.

### **Feature Importance**

The Random Forest model provides a clear ranking:

1.  **SG_TTG (0.726)**
2.  **SG_P (0.234)**
3.  **GIR% (0.021)**
4.  **Driving Distance (0.019)**

**Key Takeaways**

> **Tee-to-green strokes-gained performance is the major factor of low scoring average on PGA Tour**
>
> **Strokes-gained tee-to-green is a much stronger factor in modern PGA Tour success comparing to strokes-gained putting**
>
> **Driving distance does not have a strong correlation with low scoring average on PGA Tour**

*This aligns with Broadie (2011), who demonstrated that differences in long-game performance explain most scoring separation among professionals.*

*Broadie (2014) further expanded on this by quantifying that tee-to-green performance accounts for the largest share of scoring advantages among elite players, supporting the model’s emphasis on SG_TTG as the most influential predictor.*

### **5.3 Predicting Season Wins (Classification)**

To model whether a player wins at least one event, the same four metrics were used.

A binary variable was created to classify the groups:

**has_win = 1 if win \> 0**

**has_win = 0 otherwise**

### **Model Performance**

| Model                    | Accuracy | ROC-AUC |
|--------------------------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression      | 0.882    | 0.768   |
| Random Forest Classifier | 0.880    | 0.710   |

### **Interpretation**

Although both models have high accuracy, the models struggle to correctly identify winners:

-   Logistic Regression recall for winners = 0.04

-   Random Forest recall for winners = 0.10

This suggests that winning on PGA Tour is extremely difficult and unpredictable, because there are far more unconsidered factors beyond selected variables, such as course style, weather condition, and even luck.

Feature Importance for Wins

1.  **SG_TTG (0.299)**
2.  **GIR% (0.240)**
3.  **Driving Distance (0.231)**
4.  **Putting (0.230)**

**Key Takeaway**

> **Winning requires a complete golf game, it's very unlikely that player only reply on one part of the game to win.**

# **6. Conclusions**

### **6.1 Key Takeaways**

This paper sought to assess performance variations of PGA Tour players through time and to identify the performance metrics that differentiate elite players most from the general players. By utilising a combined dataset from 2007-2022, the analysis applied exploratory form in terms of visualizing data, unsupervised clustering and supervised predictive modeling to unveil trends that systematically evolve in modern professional golf.

**Key Findings**

1.  **Scoring averages have gradually declined over the past 15 years**, while improvements in driving distance and strokes-gained metrics are significantly positive. This reflects advancements in physical training, data driven coaching, and equipment technology.

2.  **Player archetypes have become more distinct.**\
    K-means clustering unveiled four meaningful groups: balanced professionals, struggling players, elite ball-strikers, and elite putters. These clusters align with real observed playing styles on tour and demonstrate how players succeed using different combinations of strengths.

3.  **Tee-to-green performance is the strongest predictor of scoring.**\
    Both linear regression (R² ≈ 0.91) and random forest modeling confirmed that **SG_TTG is the dominant factor in predicting scoring average**.

4.  **Winning is difficult to predict, but certain patterns emerge.**\
    Predictive models for win probability showed lower performance due to class imbalance (only \~12% of players win in a given season). However:

    -   SG_TTG remain as the strongest predictor of winning.

    -   Distance and SG_P also contributed meaningfully.

        The result is clear: **consistent ball-striking is the foundation of winning**, but without putting and driving distance winning becomes extremely difficult.

5.  **Distance alone does not explain success**, despite the upward trend in average driving distance. Players are hitting farther than before, but distance without strong tee-to-green ability does not contribute to lower score or wins.

### **6.2 Limitations**

1.  **Class Imbalance in win prediction**

    Only 337 out of 2,747 player-seasons included a win. This imbalance makes accurate prediction challenging because winning is a rare event even for elite players.

2.  **Missing years in dataset (2023-2025)**

    The analysis does not include the most recent PGA seasons, which limits the insights into current trends on Tour.

3.  **Variability in data quality across sources**

    The two datasets (2007-2017 and 2017-2022) were collected using different scraping pipelines.
