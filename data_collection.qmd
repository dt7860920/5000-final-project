## Overview

This project analyzes **PGA Tour player performance from 2007–2022**.\
Instead of scraping data from PGA live websites, I use two **publicly available raw CSV files** on GitHub to apply for my analysis.

These files are treated as **raw data** and stored in:

**data/ raw-data/ pgatour_raw.csv pga_full.csv**

# Raw Data Sources:

### pgatour_raw.csv — Original PGA Tour Scrape (2007–2017)

A compiled PGA Tour statistics dataset from a public GitHub Repository.

**Source:** Prater, D. (2017). *PGA Tour Data Science Project* \[Dataset\]. GitHub.\
https://github.com/daronprater/PGA-Tour-Data-Science-Project Example variables:

-   NAME: Player name

-   ROUNDS: Number of rounds played

-   SCORING: Scoring average

-   DRIVE_DISTANCE: Driving distance (yards)

-   FWY\_%: Fairway hit percentage

-   GIR\_%: Greens in regulation percentage

-   SG_P, SG_TTG, SG_T: Strokes gained putting, tee-to-green, and total

-   TOP 10, 1ST: Top-10 finishes and wins

-   Year: Season year

### pga_full.csv — Extended PGA Tour Stats (2017–2022)

A compiled PGA Tour statistics dataset from a public GitHub Repository.

**Source:** Ahmer, C. (2021). *PGA Tour Data Collection and Dashboard* \[Dataset\]. GitHub.\
https://github.com/charlie-ahmer/PGATour-DataCollectionAndDashboard

Example variables:

-   ScoringAvg: Score average per round

-   BirdieAvg: Average birdie per round

-   DrivingDistance: Average driving distance (yards)

-   GIR%: Greens in regulation percentage

-   Strokes-gained metrics

-   TOP 10, 1ST: Top-10 finishes and wins

-   Year: Season year

```{python}
import pandas as pd

raw_path = "data/raw-data/pgatour_raw.csv"
full_path = "data/raw-data/pga_full.csv"

pgatour_raw = pd.read_csv(raw_path, encoding="latin1")  
pga_full = pd.read_csv(full_path, encoding="latin1")   

pgatour_raw.shape, pga_full.shape
```

```{python}
pgatour_raw.head()
pgatour_raw.columns
```

```{python}
pga_full.head()
pga_full.columns
```

### Limitations on data sources: 
* Missing years in the dataset (from 2023-2025)
* Unable to scrape data directly from PGA website
* Player name inconsistencies across sources
* Different data quality between early and late years
